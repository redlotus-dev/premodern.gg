# Previewing theme changes locally

To preview theme changes locally, you need to install the Zendesk Theme CLI. The Zendesk Theme CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to preview and deploy theme changes to your Zendesk Guide account.

You can get a Zendesk trial account to test the theme changes.

## Why Zendesk?
Well, I have been using Zendesk for a while now and I have found it to be a very user-friendly platform. As the time is short, I thought it would be best to use a platform that I am familiar with but also one that is easy to use for the community and extensible for adding new features as the website grows.

**Disclaimer**

The Zendesk link provided above is for the Zendesk Suite Professional plan. You can choose the plan that best suits your needs. It has a tracking id for the partner that I am associated with. You can remove it if you want to.
